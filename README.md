# Vapour-Compression-Refrigeration-System-4E-Analysis
3E (Energy, Exergy, Economic) performance analysis and optimization of a Vapour Compression Refrigeration System (VCRS) using R1234yf, R134a, and R744 refrigerants.

# Project Overview
This project provides a **3E (Energy, Exergy, Economic)** analysis of a Vapour Compression Refrigeration System. 
The study evaluates **R1234yf, R134a and R744** as zero-ODP alternatives to traditional refrigerants using a computational model.

**Energy:** Evaluates the **Coefficient of Performance (COP)** by analyzing refrigerating effect versus compressor.

**Exergy:** Quantifies **Exergy Destruction ($E_d$)** and **Exergetic Efficiency ($\eta_{ex}$)** to identify system irreversibilities.

**Economic:** Assesses the cost-viability of substituting refrigerants based on thermodynamic performance.
